# Vesper++ Lighter
![Vesper Preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44004e38-ddd7-46e5-8a94-2d4ee01da59b)

The original theme is **Vesper** from [raunofreiberg](https://github.com/raunofreiberg/vesper) and was later enhanced with more colors by [ObstinateM](https://github.com/ObstinateM/vesper) and name **Vesper++**. This theme is a variation of **Vesper++** with a "lighter" dark color and a few tweaks to satisfy my needs and preferences.
